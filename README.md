# War Game Project

War Game project for the "Methods of Sustainable Programming" course, teached by Mikael Roos.<br />
Group members are: Einav Zilka, Dzenis Madzovic and Luan Rexhepi.

## Description
War (also known as Battle in the United Kingdom) is a simple card game, typically played by two players using a standard playing card deck â€” and often played by children. There are many variations, as well as related games such as the German 32-card Tod und Leben ("Life and Death").<br />
This is an implementation of the War card game, made completely in python. Our implementation of the war game includes two game modes:
* Short - played for 26 turns, winner is decided by who has more cards in their deck. Scores are based on the number of cards.
* Long - played until one of the players loses all cards. Scores are based on the number of draws it took to finish the game.
